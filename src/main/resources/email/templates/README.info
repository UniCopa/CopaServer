The name of the file consists of three different fields:
usrType_updateType_language.txt

where

usrType = default for every normal user who has subscribed for the update or
	  general for recipients who wish to be informed about changes to events, e.g. the general office
updateType = new to inform about new appointments
       	     upd to inform about updated appointments
	     cncld to inform about canceled appointments
language = the language code in the UserSettings from the database for the particular user, typically e.g. ENG or english





The following example shows the format of the text template: 

The first line is the E-Mail subject line
The message body begins with the second line. You can add expressions from unicopa.copa.server.email.TextPatterns 
(i.e. _UPDATE_DATE, _CREATOR_NAME, _COMMENT, _LOCATION, _DATE, _SUPERVISOR, _EVENTGROUP_NAME, _EVENT_NAME). These expressions will be replaced by the data from the SingleEventUpdate before sending E-Mails with the method notifySingleEventUpdate. This will also work in the subject line!
